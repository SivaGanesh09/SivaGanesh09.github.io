        <h1>Optimized Stock Price Prediction using Investor Sentiment and Deep Learning</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Stock Market is one of the most active research areas, and predicting its nature is an epic necessity nowadays. <br>Predicting the Stock Market is quite challenging, and it requires intensive study of the pattern of data. <br> Specific statistical models and artificially intelligent algorithms are needed to meet this challenge and arrive at an appropriate solution. <br>Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms can make a firm prediction with minimized error possibilities. <br>The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or Deep Feed forward Neural Network and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are the two network models that have <br> been used extensively to predict the stock market prices. <br>The models have been used to predict upcoming day's data values from the last few days' data values. <br>This process keeps on repeating recursively as long as the dataset is valid. <br>An endeavor has been taken to optimize this prediction using deep learning, and it has given substantial results. <br>The ANN model achieved an accuracy of 97.66%, whereas the CNN model achieved an accuracy of 98.92%. <br>The CNN model used 2‐D histograms generated out of the quantized dataset within a particular time frame, and prediction is made on that data. <br>This approach has not been implemented earlier for the analysis of such datasets. <br>As a case study, the model has been tested on the recent COVID‐19 pandemic, which caused a sudden downfall of the stock market. <br>The results obtained from this study was decent enough as it produced high accuracy.
